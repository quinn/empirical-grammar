    So what's really cool with the game of life is that very simple structures
    can create these elaborate patterns. And, again, each cell is only
    following its own simple rules. What we learn from this is that
    aggregation, like, simple things following simple rules can aggregate to
    form really complex patterns, okay. So that's. The game of, that's the
    figure eight. Now let's do the thing I call the F-famento, numbers that
    was three things in a row. Like this. And then one in the center. Off to
    the left, and one off to the right. Now let's go slowly through this. It's
    going to go once, twice, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. It
    seems to be taking on a life of its own. Let's let it go. Forever. And
    what you see is it's producing things that are like little gliders. Right,
    so it's producing things that move out through space, right? So these
    things are. It's like almost like it's alive. Now you can start thinking
    about some really interesting things. Like think about the human brain,
    right. The human brain has these neurons that follow simple rules, and by
    following these simple rules, these things are connected in such ways that
    they can create these really novel patterns that produce things like
    memory and thought and cognition and personality and all that sort of
    stuff. Well The Game of Life obviously doesn't explain cognition or
    anything of this sort, but what it does do is it shows how simple things
    following simple rules can create incredibly elaborate patterns.
